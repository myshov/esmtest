# ECMAScript Modules in Browsers (Benchmark)

[Demo](https://esmtest.myshov.com)

This experiment loads every character of the first sentence of "Crime and Punishment" by F.M. Dostoevsky with separate mjs-file (100 files in total). It shows real advantage using HTTP/2 against HTTP/1.1. For more striking experience load this site on your mobile device with 3G or just use throttling on network tab in developer tools of your browser.
